# MochaMatch app - Brew connections, one cup at a time!
- A thought out app that connects students with coffee chat mentor pairs without the intimidating thoughts of getting rejected by cold emails. 

- Our interactive UI allows for pairings to occur based on mentee/mentor interest areas (marketing, data science, SWE, etc) 
- Cards with mentor expertise and availability will pop up, clicking into the cards will allow for full personal descriptions and once booked, a progress bar will appear. 
- Current bookings will appear on the top right corner to be tracked or easily removed.
